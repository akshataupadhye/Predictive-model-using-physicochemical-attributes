# Wine Quality Prediction
 
#### Data: 
This dataset is available at the UCI Machine Learning Repository named as "Wine Quality Data Set". It contains 4898 instance with 11 physicochemical attributes which can be used to predict the quality of wine.

#### Goal: 
Use the relevant attributes to learn the best regression model to predict the quality of the wine accurately.

#### Approach: 
Used staistical methods for exploratory data analysis and feature selection to learn a n-feature regression model using the Ordinary Least Squares method.

#### Findings: 
The most significant attributes to predict the quality of wine are:

1. fixed_acidity
2. volatile_acidity
3. total_sulfur_dioxide
4. density
5. alcohol
